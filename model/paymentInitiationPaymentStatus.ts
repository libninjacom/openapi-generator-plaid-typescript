/**
* The status of the payment.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_INPUT_NEEDED`: This is the initial state of all payments. It indicates that the payment is waiting on user input to continue processing.

This error is retryable once the root cause is resolved.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_BLOCKED`: The payment has been blocked.

The payment will automatically exit this state when the financial institution has authorised the transaction.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_CANCELLED`: The payment was cancelled during authorisation.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_EXECUTED`: The payment has been successfully initiated and is considered complete.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_ESTABLISHED`: Indicates that the standing order has been successfully established.

Deprecated: These statuses will be removed in a future release.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_UNKNOWN`: The payment status is unknown.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_PROCESSING`: The payment is currently being processed. The payment will automatically exit this state when processing is complete.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_COMPLETED`: Indicates that the standing order has been successfully established.
